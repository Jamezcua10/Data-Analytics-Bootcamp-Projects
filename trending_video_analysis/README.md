# Trending videos analysis 
There are two files in this folder: the project file in jupyter notebook and a p2p report. 

The report presents the analysis of the trending videos data and respond to three key questions: 

1. Which video categories trended most often?
2. How were they distributed among regions?
3. What categories were especially popular in the United States? Were there any differences between the categories popular in the US and those popular elsewhere?
